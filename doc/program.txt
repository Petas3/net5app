Data processing application

Develop a console application for processing entrance examination results, which loads data from the report written in text file (see attached examination.txt), processes data and saves results in a suitable XML/JSON form to a file.

The correct input (rating) is an integer ranging from 0 to 100.
For each student, the application must count average using the following weights: Math 40%, Physics 35%, English 25%.
For each subject, the application must count simple average, median and modus for all data records and also separately for each group.
Resolve corrupted records and write report about them into XML/JSON file.

Results must be writable into file in XML or JSON format (command line option â€“ XML is default). Develop your own suitable XML/JSON structure.
Code must be written in C# (Microsoft C# Coding Conventions) and compilable under .NET Core 3.1, preferably .NET 5.

In design, take into consideration extensibility (perhaps more subjects, bigger amount of data) and how would you expect your program to be further used/ran by others.

Deliver the whole developed project in git repository (git archive --format zip --output /full/path/to/zipfile.zip master) or packed zip file (git is preferred option).

Please also include time spent on solving this task in your response.
